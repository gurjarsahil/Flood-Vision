# Flood Vision: Advanced Flood Prediction and Mapping System

## Project Overview

Flood Vision is a comprehensive flood prediction and mapping system that uses machine learning, computer vision, and satellite imagery to predict, analyze, and visualize flood risks. The system is designed to provide early warnings, risk assessments, and decision support for communities vulnerable to flooding.

## Key Features

- **Satellite Image Analysis**: Process and analyze satellite imagery to detect water bodies, terrain features, and infrastructure.
- **Flood Risk Prediction**: Machine learning models to predict flood probabilities based on environmental parameters.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Web-based interface for visualizing flood risks, predictions, and affected areas.
- **Decision Support**: Actionable recommendations based on flood risk assessments.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Analysis of past flood events to improve prediction accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with visualization libraries)
- **Backend**: Python, Flask (for API services)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, U-Net for image segmentation
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, GDAL for geospatial data
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly, Leaflet.js for mapping

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection

The system collects data from multiple sources:
- Satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS)
- Weather data (rainfall, temperature)
- Topographical information (elevation, slope)
- River gauge measurements
- Historical flood records

### 2. Image Processing and Feature Extraction

- **Water Detection**: Uses spectral indices (NDWI, MNDWI) to identify water bodies
- **Terrain Analysis**: Generates digital elevation models to understand water flow
- **Infrastructure Detection**: Identifies buildings, roads, and critical infrastructure in flood-prone areas

### 3. Flood Prediction Models

Multiple models work together:
- **Rainfall-Runoff Model**: Predicts how rainfall translates to water flow
- **Hydrological Model**: Simulates water movement across terrain
- **Machine Learning Classifier**: Predicts flood probability using historical patterns
- **Computer Vision Model**: Detects and segments water in new satellite images

### 4. Risk Assessment

- Combines prediction results with infrastructure data to calculate risk levels
- Generates time-to-flood estimates
- Identifies high-risk areas requiring immediate attention

### 5. Visualization and Reporting

- Interactive maps showing flood risk zones
- Time-series predictions of flood spread
- Actionable recommendations for emergency response
- Exportable reports for decision-makers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- GDAL
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flood-vision.git
   cd flood-vision
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash

   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser or use a local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Access the interface at `http://localhost:8000`

### Running the Prediction Models

1. Prepare your input data in the format specified in `data/README.md`

2. Run the prediction script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/prediction.py --input-data path/to/your/data --output path/to/save/results
   ```

### Exploring the Notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks provide detailed walkthroughs of the data analysis and model development process:

1. Start Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the notebooks in sequence:
   - Start with `data_preprocessing.ipynb`
   - Proceed to `model_training.ipynb`
   - Review results in `model_evaluation.ipynb`

## Future Development
