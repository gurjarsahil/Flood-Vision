# Flood Vision Dataset

This directory contains datasets used by the Flood Vision project for flood prediction and analysis.

## Dataset Files

- `flood_dataset.json` - Main dataset in JSON format with comprehensive flood data
- `flood_data.csv` - Simplified tabular dataset for quick analysis
- `flood_analysis.py` - Python script for analyzing and visualizing the dataset
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for the analysis script

## Dataset Structure

The JSON dataset contains the following main sections:

1. **Metadata** - General information about the dataset
2. **Locations** - Geographic locations with flood risk data
   - Each location has coordinates, risk factors, and data points
   - Data points include measurements like rainfall, river levels, and soil saturation
   - Computer vision metrics for flood detection in satellite imagery
3. **Historical Events** - Past flood events with impact data
4. **Prediction Models** - Information about machine learning models used
5. **Satellite Sources** - Details about satellite imagery sources

## Using the Python Analysis Script

The `flood_analysis.py` script demonstrates how to load and analyze the dataset. It also generates sample flood prediction overlays.

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```bash
python flood_analysis.py
```

This will:
1. Load the dataset from both JSON and CSV files
2. Analyze flood risks for each location
3. Generate sample overlay images for visualization
4. Print a summary report of flood risks

## Sample Data Description

The dataset includes four sample locations:

1. **Mississippi River Delta** - Low-lying delta with moderate urbanization
2. **Bangladesh Delta** - Flat river delta with high population density
3. **Jakarta Urban Area** - Coastal urban plain with inadequate infrastructure
4. **Rural Flood Plain** - River valley with minimal flood control

Each location includes real-world-like parameters that influence flood risk:
- Rainfall intensity (mm/hr)
- River level (m)
- Soil saturation (%)
- Computer vision metrics from satellite image analysis

## Integration with the Web Application

The web application loads this data to visualize flood risks and demonstrate the potential of computer vision in flood prediction. The overlay images generated by the Python script are displayed in the demo section of the website.
